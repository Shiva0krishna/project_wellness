- Web-based UI for user interaction

## Architecture
The architecture of the **Medical and Health Assistant** project is designed to leverage modern web and AI technologies for scalable and efficient operation.

### High-Level Architecture
1. **Frontend**: The web interface built with Next.js and TypeScript.
2. **Backend**: REST API and business logic implemented using Node.js and Express.js.
3. **Database**: Data storage managed with Supabase, utilizing PostgreSQL.
4. **Authentication**: User authentication handled by Firebase Auth, including Google Sign-In.
5. **AI/ML**: Natural Language Processing (NLP) powered by Transformer models usch as gemini.
6. **Deployment**: Application deployment managed through Supabase and vercel

### Workflow
1. **User Interaction**:
   - Users interact with the web-based UI.
   - Authentication is managed via Firebase Auth.

2. **Data Handling**:
   - User data, health metrics, and preferences are securely stored in a PostgreSQL database managed by Supabase.
   - Data is retrieved and updated through the backend APIs.

3. **AI/ML Processing**:
   - User queries and interactions are processed by Transformer models to provide personalized medical advice and recommendations.

4. **Visualization**:
   - Health metrics and analysis are presented to the user through visual graph dashboards in the frontend.

## Technologies Used
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Frontend:** Next.js with TypeScript
- **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Authentication:** Firebase Auth (including Google Sign-In)
- **Machine Learning:** Transformer models for NLP
- **Deployment:** Supabase
